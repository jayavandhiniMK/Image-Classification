# Handwritten Digit Image Classification using CNN
## Project Overview
This project implements a **Computer Vision Image Classification** system using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to recognize handwritten digits (0–9).  
The model is trained and tested on the **MNIST dataset**, which is widely used for beginner-level deep learning and computer vision tasks.
This project demonstrates the complete workflow of a basic deep learning image classification model.
